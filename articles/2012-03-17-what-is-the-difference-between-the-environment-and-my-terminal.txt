title: What is the difference between the environment and my terminal?

- If I dedicate my life to it, there's still hope for my terminal.
- One of them will always be green. (Happy St. Patrick's Day, btw.)
- I see infinitely simple beauty in one, and don't have enough time to go outside and experience the other.

Oh, what a downer-hook. Shout out to Colfax High School Journalism and UC Berkeley's Squelch Comedy magazine. I know how proud I make neither of you.

Segue. I honestly forgot I had a blog. [Whoops](/about)! Right?

Whatever. Doesn't faze me. I've been too busy being engaged, cofounding [HealthyLabs](http://healthylabs.com/), and climbing to notice that my site was essentially down for the last 3 months:

    > blog_live = Time.new(2011, 11, 2)
    2011-11-02 00:00:00 -0700
    > blog_died = Time.new(2011, 12, 13)
    2011-12-13 00:00:00 -0800
    > blog_live_again = Time.now
    2012-03-17 15:51:55 -0700
    > "%.2f \%" % ((blog_died - blog_live) / (blog_live_again - blog_live) * 100)
    "30.03 %"

So there you have it:

> **30.03%** uptime guaranteed.  
> That's theWillCole SLA.

On the bright side, I'll be getting back into it with a vengeance. A blistery, steamy, more than once-every-3-months vengeance. Oooh yeah, baby.

Right? I'm psyched too!

Email me if there's a particular one that you want me to write first.

Have a lucky day.
