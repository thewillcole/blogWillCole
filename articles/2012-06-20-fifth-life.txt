##I'm 25 today.

And yes, I'm going to live to be 125 years old.

    24 was my best year.

To call this past year perfect would be to recklessly embellish and specifically forget. But it was pretty damn close.  

How can life get better than this? Well...

Since I'm feeling so happy about things, I want to give credit.

**Thanks to my fiance**: I love you and I can't wait to keep spending my life with you.

**Thanks to my parents**: You guys kick ass. Letting your grown son quit his real job and crash in your appartment is nothing short of heroism. I know I will do the same when the time comes.

**Thanks to my sisters**: You two make me keep it real. I respect the hell out of you.

**Thanks to my friends**: I wish we all lived in the same city and had infinite time to spend together. You're all fabulous.

**Thanks to my cofounder**: You're the man. I'm super excited about what we're doing and I couldn't picture a better person to do it with.  

**Thanks to you, my unloyal readers**: I will be posting a mini-blog-series in July, which I am currently writing, and then producing regular updates from there on out.  

Cheers,

`William Bates Cole III`
