Dear Vincent Woo of vincentwoo.com fame,  

As the sole reader of thewillcole.com, you must be disappointed.  

You came here expecting the first of many posts, but all you get is this half-assed open letter.  

And you know what the worst part is?

This letter is so short and substanceless that this is literally the penultimate line.  

Cheers,

Will Cole

ps. I rehashed a David Mitchell joke and referenced that fact that the word 'literally' has a new definition. Watch out 2006 and early 2013.
