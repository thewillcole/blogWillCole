A man once said:

Through the process of writing this blog, I feel like I can become the kind of person that I always wanted to be. Or, to put it more simply: I want to be the kind of person who keeps a blog.

Good, now that we've got my attempt at humor out of the way, let's get down to
busines:

SkyDeck accepted my company into their incubator! Hurray!!!

And that's pretty much all I have to say about that right now, because I'm busy playing aorund with code...I'm sorry for being so rude.
