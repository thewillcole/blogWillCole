title: So This is a Blog.

Hurray! This is my first blog because I'm pretending that my abysmal Yahoo! GeoCities, MySpace blog, and BlogSpot (now Blogger) didn't count. Why? So I can lie to myself that I'll actually write stuff in this one for a change. Honestly, I give it 3 weeks before I dread the thought of having to write a new post and 6 weeks before I take it down out of guilt for not writing anything.

So where does this lates- *Ahem* first blog find me in life? I've given up my job in Seattle to co-found a startup in The Valley. My buddy from college has put in the leg work to come up with an idea, build a site, attract a few users, get office space, and network. My work is cut out for me: catch up, do my share, and then keep going. Hmm...that would make a good tagline for my blog.

See, I've got a great opportunity on my hands. I'm going to learn a whole bunch in the coming year -not that you're going to get to see more than two weeks of it on this blog- and this blog is the forum I'm choosing to share it on. Heh.

Random thoughts will probably wiggle their way into becoming posts as well. But for now, I'll just write about running a my startup. So you can expect at least one or two posts about the finer points of time/project management and how awesome I am at being productive in an unstructured environment. Then Toto (the platform I intend to blog on) will go the way of GeoCities. That is to say, I'll get too busy to write anymore.
